# Weather-App-JS
Weather app made using HTML , CSS , JS using weather API
This app uses "openweathermap" API...to display the temperature and weather details.
Javascript is used to change the background of the body to DAY and NIGHT dynamically using current time of that particular place.
I have also tried to design a dynamically changing night and dark modes...using JS.
Personalized day and night pngs have been used to dynamically display the current weather along with current time (Day or Night) for a more user appealing interface.
I have tried my best in optimizing the code and I surely think there is more room for optimization.
